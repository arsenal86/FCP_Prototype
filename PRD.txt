Product Requirements Document: Horizon Scanning & Assessment Platform
Version: 1.1

Date: July 6, 2025

Author: Marc Debenham

1. Introduction
1.1. The Problem
The financial and property sectors are subject to a high volume of constantly evolving regulations from numerous sources (e.g., FCA, GOV.UK, NCA). Manually tracking, assessing, and communicating the impact of these changes is a time-consuming, inefficient, and error-prone process. This reactive approach creates a significant risk of non-compliance, missed deadlines, and a lack of strategic foresight. Teams lack a centralized, collaborative platform to manage this workflow, leading to siloed information and duplicated effort.

1.2. Vision
Our vision is to create a centralized, AI-powered platform that transforms regulatory compliance from a reactive chore into a proactive, strategic advantage. The Horizon Scanning & Assessment Platform will automate the aggregation of regulatory updates, leverage Generative AI to accelerate analysis, and provide clear, actionable insights across the business through intuitive workflows and visualizations.

2. User Personas
P1: Compliance Analyst (Primary User)

Role: Responsible for the day-to-day monitoring of regulatory sources, performing initial analysis and impact assessments, and escalating high-priority items.

Goals: To quickly identify relevant updates, reduce time spent on manual summarization, and collaborate effectively with the team on assessments.

Frustrations: Wasting time manually checking multiple websites, re-reading dense legal text, and communicating findings via disjointed emails and documents.

P2: Compliance Manager (Secondary User)

Role: Oversees the compliance function, reviews and validates assessments, assigns tasks, and reports on the overall regulatory landscape to senior management.

Goals: To have a high-level overview of all pending and completed assessments, ensure consistency and quality of analysis, and easily track key deadlines and upcoming changes.

Frustrations: Lack of visibility into the team's workload, difficulty in tracking the status of multiple assessments, and spending too much time compiling reports.

P3: Business Stakeholder (e.g., Head of Lettings)

Role: Leads a specific business unit and needs to understand how regulatory changes will affect their operations, processes, and staff.

Goals: To receive clear, concise, and relevant summaries of impactful changes without having to read the full regulatory text.

Frustrations: Receiving dense, legalistic emails that are hard to decipher and don't clearly state the required actions for their department.
